// You will be given an encoded message and a template matrix for decoding it. The decoding is done by overlaying the template on top of the
//  stone with the message and performing an arithmetic operation with the numbers that overlap. Each pair of numbers (one from the message
//  and one from the template matrix) is added together and the resulting number is located on the wheel of letters (pictured to the You
//  may count more than one full revolution around the wheel (e.g. 6 is the same as 33 and so on). Repeat this process for all symbols of the message.
// If the decoding template matrix is smaller than the message, shift the template horizontally by as many cells as it is wide, so it covers the
//  next section of the message (see example). Once you reach the last column of the message matrix, if there are more rows left, shift the template
//  back to the first column, but offset it vertically by as many cells as it is high. See the exampleâ€™s explanation for more information.
// Input
// You will receive an array of strings. The first element represents a number n, which is the length of the template matrix for decoding. 
// The next n elements represent rows in the decoding template matrix, with columns separated by space. The rest of the elements are all rows
//  of the encoded message matrix, with columns in each row separated by space.
// Output
// Print the decoded message in uppercase on a single line on the console. The final message is joined from all resulting cells, starting from top left,
//  going right, row by row. Trailing spaces are ignored.
