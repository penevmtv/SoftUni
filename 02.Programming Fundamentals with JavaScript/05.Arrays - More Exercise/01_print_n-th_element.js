//Write a function that collects each element of an array, on a given step.

//The input comes as an array of strings. The last element is N - the step.

//If the step is "3", you need to print the 1-st, the 4-th, the 7-th â€¦ and so on, until you reach the end of the array. 
//Then, print elements in a row, separated by a single space.
