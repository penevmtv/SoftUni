// You are given a sequence of people and for every person what cards he draws from the deck. 
// The input will be an array of strings. Each string will be in the format:
// {personName}: {PT, PT, PT,â€¦ PT}
// Where P (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) is the power of the card and T (S, H, D, C) is the type.
//  The name can contain any ASCII symbol except ':'. The input will always be valid and in the format described, there is no need to check it.
// A single person cannot have more than one card with the same power and type, if he draws such a card he discards it.
//  The people are playing with multiple decks. Each card has a value that is calculated by the power multiplied by the type.
//   Powers 2 to 10 have the same value and J to A are 11 to 14. Types are mapped to multipliers the following way (S -> 4, H-> 3, D -> 2, C -> 1).
// Finally print out the total value each player has in his hand in the format:
