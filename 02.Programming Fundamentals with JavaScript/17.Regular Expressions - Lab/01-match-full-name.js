// Write a JavaScript function to match full names from a list of names and print them on the console.
// Writing the Regular Expression
// First, write a regular expression to match a valid full name, according to these conditions:
// •	A valid full name has the following characteristics:
// o	It consists of two words.
// o	Each word starts with a capital letter.
// o	After the first letter, it only contains lowercase letters afterward.
// o	Each of the two words should be at least two letters long.
// o	The two words are separated by a single space.
// To help you out, we've outlined several steps:
// 1.	Use an online regex tester like https://regex101.com/ 
// 2.	Check out how to use character sets (denoted with square brackets - "[]")
// 3.	Specify that you want two words with a space between them (the space character ' ', and not any whitespace symbol)
// 4.	For each word, specify that it should begin with an uppercase letter using a character set. The desired characters are in a range – from 'A' to 'Z'.
// 5.	For each word, specify that what follows the first letter are only lowercase letters, one or more – use another character set and the correct quantifier.
// 6.	To prevent capturing of letters across new lines, put "\b" at the beginning and the end of your regex. This will ensure that what precedes and what follows 
// the match is a word boundary (like a new line).
